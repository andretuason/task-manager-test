# task-manager-test
 Basically my vue and bootstrap vue playground

Currently using json-server that is mounted on localhost:5000
that reads from db.json on the root for dummy data

to use:
npm run serve 
npm run json-server

make sure port 5000 is open for the json server as program is currently hard coded to read from localhost:5000
